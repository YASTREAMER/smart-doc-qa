## ⚙️ Automation Pipeline Explained

The entire pipeline runs automatically with a single command (`python run.py`). Here's what happens under the hood:

### Step 1 — Scraper (`pipeline/scraper.py`)
Fetches raw legal content for all 5 topics from the Wikipedia API using structured queries. Saves plain text to `data/raw/<topic>.txt` along with the source URL for citations. No manual content — fully automated.

### Step 2 — Processor (`pipeline/processor.py`)
Loads each raw text file and splits it into overlapping 800-character chunks using LangChain's `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`. Each chunk is embedded using `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (runs locally, no API cost) and stored in a per-topic FAISS vector index saved to `data/faiss_index/`.

### Step 3 — Generator (`pipeline/generator.py`)
Sends the first 4000 characters of each topic's text to Groq's LLaMA 3 70B model with a structured JSON prompt. The model returns a card description, 250-word plain-English summary, key rights, important provisions, penalties, and who can benefit. Results are saved to `data/cards.json`.

### Smart Caching
`run.py` checks if each step's output already exists before running it. Re-running `python run.py` is instant if data is already present. Use `python run.py --reset` to force a full re-run.

## 🧗 Challenges Faced

## 🧗 Challenges Faced

### 1. Finding a Reliable Legal Data Source
The first challenge was identifying a source that could be scraped programmatically
without hitting paywalls or bot protection. indiankanoon.org — the most comprehensive
Indian legal database — blocked all automated requests with 403 errors. Their API
requires a paid subscription. Government sources like indiacode.nic.in serve content
as PDFs with inconsistent formatting. Solved by switching to the Wikipedia API which
is free, open, returns clean plain text, and has solid coverage of all 5 legal topics.
This kept the pipeline fully automated without any manual content preparation.

### 2. Reducing API Costs and Groq Call Volume
With 5 topics each requiring summary generation, key info extraction, and Q&A
answering, uncached API calls would add up fast. Solved this in three ways:
- Groq was chosen over OpenAI — it is significantly faster and cheaper for the same
  LLaMA 3 70B model
- Generator runs once and caches all output to `cards.json` — Groq is never called
  again for summaries or key info unless `--reset` is used
- Q&A answers are cached in Streamlit's `@st.cache_data` — the same question on
  the same topic only hits Groq once per session, after which it is served from RAM

### 3. Implementing In-Memory (RAM) Caching
Streamlit reruns the entire script on every user interaction, which would reload the
FAISS index and re-embed queries on every button click — making the app extremely slow.
Solved by using two levels of caching:
- `@st.cache_resource` for the FAISS vectorstore — loads the index once and keeps it
  in RAM for the entire session, shared across all users
- `@st.cache_data` for Q&A answers and audio generation — results are stored in memory
  keyed by input, so identical calls return instantly without any compute or API cost

### 4. LangChain Module Restructuring
`langchain.text_splitter` was moved to a separate `langchain_text_splitters` package
in newer LangChain versions, causing import errors that weren't obvious from the
documentation. Fixed by installing `langchain-text-splitters` separately and updating
the import path.

### 5. Speech-to-Text Library Incompatibility
`streamlit-audiorec`, the standard Streamlit audio recording component, does not
support Python 3.14. Rather than downgrading Python, replaced live recording with
`st.file_uploader` accepting wav/mp3/m4a files, piped directly into Groq's
`whisper-large-v3` for transcription. This is more practical for end users who can
record on their phone and upload.

### 6. Groq Returning Non-JSON Responses
Despite explicit prompting to return only raw JSON, the LLM would occasionally wrap
responses in markdown code fences. Added a pre-parse stripping step that detects and
removes triple backticks before passing to `json.loads()`, making the pipeline
resilient to LLM formatting inconsistencies.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

1. **MongoDB integration** — Store Q&A cache and chat history in MongoDB for persistence across sessions and reduced API calls
2. **Authentication** — User login with personal chat history and bookmarks
3. **Multi-language support** — Hindi and regional language summaries for wider accessibility
4. **Dockerization** — Containerize the full stack for one-command deployment anywhere
5. **More legal topics** — Expand beyond 5 topics to cover IPC, labour laws, property laws
6. **Real-time legal updates** — Periodic pipeline re-runs to keep content current with legislative changes
7. **AI Search** — Cross-topic semantic search across all legal content
8. **Integrating Indian Kanoon API** — Integrating Indian Kanoon API to get more accurate answers
